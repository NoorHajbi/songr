//	Ensure you have tested the constructor, getters, and setters for the Album class.


//	Stretch Goals
//	Modify your /hello route to allow users to specify their name with a query parameter, like /hello?name=Joe, and get a custom hello message back.
//	Modify your /hello route to expect a POST request instead of a GET request. Use Postman for manual testing.
//	Create a route that takes in a number, and then makes a request to the Numbers API to get a fact about that number. Return the fact.
//	Create a route that tells the user information about their computer. For example, it might tell them what browser they’re using, what OS they’re using, what their IP address is, and other such information. (Hint: This information is in the headers of the request that comes in to the server, so you may want to look at the request headers.)
